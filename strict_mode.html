    <h1>JS Strict Mode</h1>
    <p>
      JavaScript strict mode is an ECMAScript 5 feature that allows developers
      to opt into a restricted and safer variant of the language. Enabling it
      changes previously silent errors into thrown errors, helps enforce better
      coding practices, and improves performance and security.
